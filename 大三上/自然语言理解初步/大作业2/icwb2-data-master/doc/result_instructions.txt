Bakeoff 2005 Result Submission Instructions

Thank you for participating in the 2nd International Chinese Word
Segmentation Bakeoff. Please read this message completely: it
contains very important information on result submission.

This message contains the instructions for submitting your
results so that they can be scored. I originally planned to
update the website to allow you to upload your results, but I
decided against this for two reasons:

1) Many participants are running tracks that are different from
   what they signed up for, or wish to submit alternate runs
   within a track. Writing a web application to handle this
   correctly and reliably is difficult, and errors cannot be
   tolerated.

2) Connectivity to the SIGHAN site has been problematic for some
   participants, especially in China. I do not want cause undue
   stress on them if there are problems.

Therefore you should submit your results _by_email_ to me at this
address:

                           tree@sighan.org

The subject of the message should be

                    Bakeoff 2005 Result Submission

The message should be sent by the primary investigator, i.e., the
one who registered for participation. This is how I will match
your submission to your registration.

Please use the following conventions:

1) Submit a single archive file (.zip, .rar, .tar.gz, or
   .tar.bz2) containing your output file(s). Do this even if you
   are submitting a single result file.

2) The archive should be named with the email user id of the
   submitter. For example, "tree@sighan.org" would
   submit "tree.zip".

3) Each test file should be named X_test_result_[OC]_Y.Z where

   X    is the name of the corpus: pku, cityu, as, msr
   [OC] is whether the result is for the Open or Closed track
   Y    is an optional identifier (a lower-case letter) for
          multiple runs of the system
   Z    is the file suffix, .txt or .utf8

   For example, the results of running the UTF-8 encoded PKU
   corpus in the closed track in a single run would be

                        pku_test_result_C.utf8

   Running the CP950 version of the Academia Sinica corpus in the
   open track with two alternate systems would be

                        as_test_result_O_a.txt
                        as_test_result_O_b.txt

   Note that 'a' and 'b' is used to distinguish two separate runs
   on this corpus.

4) The deadline for which I will accept result submissions is
   14:00 GMT on Friday, July 29. Results received after this time
   will not be scored unless the team can provide me with a
   *very* good reason to allow the extension (e.g., the building
   burned down, the national computer network went down, etc.)

   To minimize confusion, 14:00 GMT on 2005/07/29 is:

   07:00 2005/07/29 in San Francisco
   10:00 2005/07/29 in New York
   22:00 2005/07/29 in Hong Kong
   22:00 2005/07/29 in Beijing
   22:00 2005/07/29 in Taipei
   22:00 2005/07/29 in Singapore
   23:00 2005/07/29 in Seoul
   23:00 2005/07/29 in Tokyo

Answers to Some Common Questions

The AS testing data had the spaces between English words
inadvertantly removed. You will *not* be penalized for not
segmenting English text.

The AS training data used full-width space (U+3000, Big Five
0xA140) to separate tokens. You can use either the full-width
space or the normal ASCII space (0x20) in your result submission:
these are scored equally. PLEASE NOTE: this is the *only*
full-width/half-width normalization that is allowed! Do not
convert full-width punctuation or Latin characters to half-width,
these will *not* be scored correctly.
